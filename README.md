# Description
Termix is an open-source forever free self-hosted SSH (other protocols planned, see [Planned Features](#planned-features)) management panel inspired by [Nexterm](https://github.com/gnmyt/Nexterm). Its purpose is to provide an all-in-one docker-hosted web solution to manage your servers in one easy place. I'm using this project to help me learn [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) but also because I could never settle on a server management software that I enjoyed to use.

> [!WARNING]  
> This app is in the VERY early stages of development. Expect bugs, data loss, and possibly even security issues!

# Planned Features
- [x] SSH
- [ ] VNC
- [ ] RDP
- [ ] SMTP (build in file transfer)
- [ ] Split Screen & Tabs
- [ ] ChatGPT/Ollama Integration (for commands)
- [ ] Login Screen

# How Termix is Different
Before developing Termix, I faced the issue of a server management panel that did not have every feature I liked. [Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) had poor copy/paste abilities and a poor UI. [Shellngn](https://shellngn.com/) was too expensive and all other alternatives had one major problem with them. I plan to develop the management panel of my dreams with even an AI integration for those pesky commands I always forget the syntax of.

# Installation
